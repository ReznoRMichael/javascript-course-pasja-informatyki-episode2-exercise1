## General info
The basics of JavaScript. In this exercise a user inputs something into a text form, and after clicking "Sprawd≈∫" the script checks if it's not a number, if it's zero, or what the sign this number has, each time displaying an appriopriate text. If the user doesn't enter anything, it also shows info about it.
